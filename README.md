# Bitwier_sorting
 Sort numbers by bitwise sorting.

 To start using it set array size by entering count of numbers in "Размер массива". Then enter an array itself separated by a space in "Массив".

 Afterwards you have two aptions: see how it sorts by clicking "Step-by-step" or see result right away by clicking "Запуск".
